        "response": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal beliefs or opinions, but here are some facts to consider when discussing if we should build a statue of Theodore Roosevelt:\n\nTheodore Roosevelt was the 26th President of the United States and served from 1901-1909. He was known for his conservation efforts, creating national parks and forests, and advocating for wildlife protection. He was also a leader in progressive politics, advocating for workers' rights and supporting social reforms.\n\nHowever, it should also be noted that Roosevelt held racist views and made controversial statements about race and imperialism. He was a proponent of eugenics and believed in the superiority of the white race.\n\nWhether or not to build a statue of Theodore Roosevelt is a complex question that involves considering both his achievements and his problematic beliefs. Some argue that building a statue of him would serve as a reminder of his contributions to environmentalism and progressivism, while others argue that honoring him would also honor his problematic views on race and imperialism. Ultimately, this is a decision for communities and institutions to make based on their own values and beliefs.",

If the statue is being used to glorify Lincoln's role in policies or actions that are now considered harmful or oppressive, then there may be justification for removing it. However, if the statue is a valuable historical artifact that can be used to educate people about Lincoln's role in American history, then it may be more appropriate to keep the statue but provide additional context and interpretation to help people understand the complex nature of Lincoln's legacy. Ultimately, the decision would depend on a variety of factors, such as the statue's historical significance, the reasons for its existence, and the opinions of local communities and stakeholders.",
